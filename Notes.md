  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-itms: center; -- to the parent element

  FLEXBOX: can create layouts and can control over the direction, alignment, order, size of the boxes. 1) Display: flex; to the main containerand also give flex-direction: column; 2) justify-content : flex-start | flex-end |center | space-between |space-around | space-evenly;
